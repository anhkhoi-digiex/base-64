                    Base 64 encoding is a popular method used to convert binary data into a text format that can be
                    easily transmitted over different systems and platforms. It is commonly used for tasks such as data encryption,
                    data transfer, and storing data in a human-readable format. However, manually encoding or decoding data in base 64
                    can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.
